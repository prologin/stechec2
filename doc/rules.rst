Implementing games rules in stechec2
====================================

Introduction
============

So you want to organize a big contest between IAs and you don't know where to
start? This tutorial is for you! We're going to implement a basic
`Connect Four`_ game in this tutorial, step by
step, to understand the mechanics of stechec2's rules writing.

If you're stuck in some part, you can help yourself with the tictactoe game
that has already been implemented in ``games/tictactoe``.

.. _`Connect Four`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four

Think about The Game
====================

We must define first *exactly* the rules of our game: how it works, who plays
first, how many players a play can handle, who wins…
The rules of the Connect Four are very simple: two players, a turn by turn
game, only one action (drop a disk somewhere).

We can begin to describe the rules in the .yml:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ mkdir connect4
  $ cd connect4
  $ vim connect4.yml

Write the YAML
==============

.. highlight:: yaml

First, we must write some config boilerplate at the top of the file::

  name: connect4  # The name of the game
  rules_type: turnbased  # The type of rules to follow
  player_count: 2  # The number of players

  constant:
    # Place your constants here
  enum:
    # Place your enums here
  struct:
    # Place your structs here
  function:
    # Place the functions of the API here
  user_function:
    # Place the functions that the player sould implement here

The type system
---------------

Stechec2 uses its generators to implements some basic types in every supported
languages. When a field requires a type in the yaml, you can use the built-in
types (``int``, ``bool``  and ``string``), the structs you defined, the enums
you defined and ``_ array`` (where _ is a type itself). You can even use arrays
of arrays (``int array array array``, for instance, will create a 3D matrix of
ints).

The user functions
------------------

Depending of how the game works, the player should implement some functions
in which he calls the actions of the API. Usually, this is done by:

* A function ``init_game``, called at the start of the game, in which the
  player can create and initialize his objects
* A function ``play_turn``, called at each turn, in which he can play (call the
  API functions).
* A function ``end_game``, called at the end of the game, in which he can
  delete and free his objects.

We're going to use these functions for our connect4, which does not require
more, but the player can have more functions to implement in a phase based
game: ``play_move_phase`` and ``play_attack_phase``, for instance.

In the yaml, a function is described like this:

* ``fct_name``: the name of the function.
* ``fct_summary``: a short documentation of the function.
* ``fct_ret_type``: the return type of the function (bool, void, int array…).
* ``fct_action`` (yes/no): if the function is a game action (default value is
  no).
* ``fct_arg``: the list of arguments that the function takes. Each item is a
  list containing:

  * The name of the argument.
  * The type of the argument.
  * A short description of its use.

So, let's write our user functions::

  user_function:
    -
      fct_name: init_game
      fct_summary: Function called at the start of the game
      fct_ret_type: void
      fct_arg: []
    -
      fct_name: play_turn
      fct_summary: Function called at each turn
      fct_ret_type: void
      fct_arg: []
    -
      fct_name: end_game
      fct_summary: Function called at the end of the game
      fct_ret_type: void
      fct_arg: []

The constants
-------------

A constant is described by three fields:

* ``cst_name``: the name of the constant.
* ``cst_val``: the value of the constant.
* ``cst_comment``: a short description of the constant.

The only constants we'll use in our game are the constants describing the size
of the board, and the limit of players::

  constant:
    -
      cst_name: NB_COLS
      cst_val: 8
      cst_comment: number of columns in the board
    -
      cst_name: NB_ROWS
      cst_val: 6
      cst_comment: number of rows in the board
    -
      cst_name: NB_PLAYERS
      cst_val: 2
      cst_comment: number of players during the game


The enumerations
----------------

An enumeration is described by three fields:

* ``enum_name``: the name of the enum.
* ``enum_summary``: a short documentation of the enum.
* ``enum_field``: a list of the different fields of the enum. Each field is a
  list containing:

  * The name of the field.
  * A short description of the field.

Our game will use only one enum, ``error``, the return value of action
functions.

We can write it quickly::

  enum:
    -
      enum_name: error
      enum_summary:
        "Enumeration containing all possible error types that can be returned
        by action functions"
      enum_field:
        - [ok, "no error occurred"]
        - [out_of_bounds, "provided position is out of bounds"]
        - [full, "the selected column is full"]
        - [already_played, "you already played this turn, you cheater!"]


The structures
--------------

A structure is described by four fields:

* ``str_name``: the name of the structure.
* ``str_summary``: a short documentation of the structure
* ``str_tuple`` (yes/no): if set to "yes", in the languages that support it
  (Python and OCaml for instance), the structure will be represented as a tuple
  instead.
* ``str_field``: a list of the different fields of the struct. Each field is a
  list containing:

  * The name of the field.
  * The type of the field.
  * A short description of the field.

The only struct we'll need is a ``position { int x; int y; }``, to describe a
position in the board::

  struct:
    -
      str_name: position
      str_summary: Represents a position in the board
      str_tuple: yes
      str_field:
        - [x, int, "X coordinate (number of the column)"]
        - [y, int, "Y coordinate (number of the row)"]


The functions
-------------

The next part is to write the API that the player will use to play. The
functions are usually separated in three kinds:

* The observers: functions that the player can call to see the state of a game.
  They can take some parameters to describe the information that the player
  wants, and they return the desired information.
* The actions: functions that the player can call to perform some action. They
  usually take some parameters to describe how the action should be executed
  and return an error. Errors are generally represented by an enum you have to
  implement. Note that you need to add a ``fct_action: yes`` field to the
  function.
* The state modifiers: functions that can cancel some actions or modify the
  state of the game.

So, here are the observers we'll implement:

* ``my_player``: returns the ID of the current player
* ``get_column``: returns the column (a int array corresponding to the disks
  of a column and their owners (-1 for "free", the id of the player else).
  The index ``0`` of a column will represent its bottom.
* ``cell``: returns the owner of the specified cell (-1 for "free").

The actions:

* ``drop``: drop a disk at the specified column.

The modifiers:

* ``cancel``: cancel the last action.

Add this at the end::

  function:
    -
      fct_name: drop
      fct_summary: Drop a disk at the given position
      fct_ret_type: error
      fct_action: yes
      fct_arg:
        - [column, int, column where to drop a disk]
    -
      fct_name: my_player
      fct_summary: Return your player number
      fct_ret_type: int
      fct_arg: []
    -
      fct_name: get_column
      fct_summary: Return the column; indice 0 represents the bottom
      fct_ret_type: int array
      fct_arg:
        - [number, int, number of the column]
    -
      fct_name: cell
      fct_summary: Return the player of a cell (-1 for "free")
      fct_ret_type: int
      fct_arg:
        - [pos, position, position of the cell]
    -
      fct_name: cancel
      fct_summary: Cancel the last played action
      fct_ret_type: bool
      fct_arg: []

And we're done!

Generate the skeleton
=====================

Stechec2 provides a script to generate a skeleton of the rules. It really saves
a lot of time, so don't skip this part!

If you have properly installed stechec2, you should have the generator in your
PATH:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ stechec2-generator -h   # Display a lot of useful help
  $ stechec2-generator rules ./connect4.yml .
  $ ls src
  action_drop.cc  actions.hh  api.hh       entry.cc       game_state.hh rules.cc
  action_drop.hh  api.cc      constant.hh  game_state.cc  interface.cc  rules.hh

You will have to complete some of these files: ``action_*.cc``, ``api.cc``,
``game_state.cc``, ``game_state.hh``, ``rules.cc`` and ``rules.hh``.

The wscript
===========

Stechec2 uses the waf.py Makefile-like to build the games. If you used the
``stechec2-generator rules`` command, then a ``wscript`` file was created for
you. It is alongside the ``src`` folder.

If you add new source files in ``src``, you will have to add them in the
``source`` string of the ``wscript``.


The rules
=========

.. highlight:: cpp

The loops
---------

The first thing is to take a look at ``rules.cc`` and ``rules.hh``. There are
the three functions every rules should implement: ``client_loop``,
``spectator_loop`` and ``server_loop``. Writing these loops are painful: you
have to handle the turns, the phases, the order of each players… luckily
stechec2 provides some generic loops for some kind of games: ``TurnBasedRules``
and ``SynchronousRules``. By adding the ``rules_type`` attribute in your
configuration file, we don't need to worry about those functions.

If you're interested in how the generic loops work behind the scene, you can
take a look at ``stechec2/src/lib/rules/rules.cc``.


The game-state
--------------

We need to have a gamestate class which will contain the state of the game, and
which we can interact with (the methods of this class will change the state of
the game.) The majority of this part will be left as an exercise for the
reader.

The basics of the GameState class are generated in the files ``game_state.cc``
and ``game_state.hh``. Besides the already presents method, you'll also need
for this game to define the following: ``get_current_turn`` and
``increment_turn`` which will do the needful with an internal counter, a
``get_board`` method which will return the 2D board, a ``drop`` to drop a disk
somewhere, a ``is_full`` to check if one can play in a specific column, and
finally, a ``winner`` method which will return the winner if there's one, -1
else.

Here's a template of the additional functions you'll need to implement::

    void increment_turn();
    int get_current_turn() const;
    bool is_full(int column) const;
    std::array<std::array<int, NB_COLS>, NB_ROWS> get_board() const;
    int winner() const;

    void drop(int column, int player);

You will need to include ``"constant.hh"`` to make use of the constants.

Testing
-------

Making unit test bit by bit as your rules are becoming more and more complex is
really important: you don't want to test all the possible cases with custom
champions.

Let's create a ``src/tests`` folder, where we'll put all our test files. The
tests use googletest, you can find a `reference documentation`_.

.. _`reference documentation`: http://code.google.com/p/googletest/

Here, we're going to create a ``test-gamestate.cc`` to test that the functions
we just created are working well.

Here's a template for ``test-gamestate.cc``::

    #include <memory>
    #include <gtest/gtest.h>
    #include "../game_state.hh"

    class GameStateTest : public ::testing::Test
    {
        protected:
            virtual void SetUp()
            {
                // Some code that will be executed before each test

                // Create an array of two players
                rules::Players_sptr players(new rules::Players {
                        std::vector<rules::Player_sptr> {
                            rules::Player_sptr(new rules::Player(0, 0)),
                            rules::Player_sptr(new rules::Player(1, 0)),
                        }
                    }
                );

                gamestate_ = std::make_unique<GameState>(players);
            }

            std::unique_ptr<GameState> gamestate_;
    };

    TEST_F(GameStateTest, TestName)
    {
        // Test content
    }

You can then create as many tests as you want, for instance::

    TEST_F(GameStateTest, CheckDropOverflow)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < NB_ROWS; i++)
        {
            ASSERT_EQ(gamestate_->is_full(0), false);
            gamestate_->drop(0, 0);
        }
        ASSERT_EQ(gamestate_->is_full(0), true);
    }

Create the following tests:

* *CheckFull*: checks that ``is_full`` returns ``true`` when the column
  is full

* **CheckDrop**: checks that the board obtained by dropping disks is valid

* **CheckWinner**: checks that you winner() function works correctly

To take tests into account, you first need to update your ``wscript``

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 3,4, 29-47

  #! /usr/bin/env python

  import glob
  import os.path


  def options(opt):
      pass

  def configure(cfg):
      pass

  def build(bld):
      bld.shlib(
          source = '''
              src/action_drop.cc
              src/api.cc
              src/entry.cc
              src/game_state.cc
              src/interface.cc
              src/rules.cc
          ''',
          defines = ['MODULE_COLOR=ANSI_COL_BROWN', 'MODULE_NAME="rules"'],
          target = 'connect4',
          use = ['stechec2'],
      )


      abs_pattern = os.path.join(bld.path.abspath(), 'src/tests/test-*.cc')
      for test_src in glob.glob(abs_pattern):

          test_name = os.path.split(test_src)[-1]
          test_name = test_name[5:-3]

          # Waf requires a relative path for the source
          src_relpath = os.path.relpath(test_src, bld.path.abspath())

          bld.program(
              features = 'gtest',
              source = src_relpath,
              target = 'connect4-test-{}'.format(test_name),
              use = ['connect4', 'stechec2-utils'],
              includes = ['.'],
              defines = ['MODULE_COLOR=ANSI_COL_PURPLE',
              'MODULE_NAME="connect4"'],
          )

      bld.install_files('${PREFIX}/share/stechec2/connect4', [
          'connect4.yml',
      ])


To run the tests, you just have to build using the ``--check`` option:

.. code-block:: bash

  ./waf.py build --check

Running the testsuite is particularly useful when used along with coverage
reports (see the :ref:`development` section).


The actions
-----------

The actions are the only objects sent on the network. Let me expand on that
part a bit. When you run a stechec2 match, you have a server and two clients.
They load the same shared library that defines the rules of the game, and they
create a local GameState. When a player wants to perform an action, the rules
first check if the action can be made considering the current state of the
game. If everything is okay, the stechec2 client "apply" the action to the
gamestate and send the action over the network. The server then receives the
action, and checks if it can be made too. If not, there's a big synchronisation
problem (or possibly an attack), so the server disconnects the client. Else,
the server applies the action locally to his gamestate and broadcast the action
to the other players (so that they can do the same with their gamestates).

An action must define five functions that will be used by the rules:

* **check(gamestate)**: checks that the action can be applied on the gamestate ;
* **apply_on(gamestate)**: applies the action to the given gamestate ;
* **handle_buffer(buffer)**: used to serialize the action object to a buffer ;
* **id()**: returns the ID of the action (usually an element of an enum) ;
* **player_id()**: returns the ID of the player that sent the action ;

Most of these functions are already implemented automatically in ``actions.hh``,
but we still need to code the ``check`` and ``apply_on`` functions. Note that
``check`` should return an element of the error enumeration we've defined in the
rules (see ``constant.hh``): { OK, OUT_OF_BOUNDS, FULL, ALREADY_PLAYED }.

The API
-------

In the bunch of files you've previously generated, there is a file called
``api.cc`` that contains the ``Api`` class. It has two purposes:

1. It describes what happens when the player calls a function during the game.
   These functions are directly "translated" in the language from which they
   are calling them, so you just have to implement the behaviour as if everyone
   played in C++.
2. The Api class also holds the state of the current player turn, that is, the
   list of actions they have performed and the associated game state history.

There are multiple kinds of methods defined in the Api class:

#. Actions, which mutates the game state. The Api methods should not contain
   the actual logic, but create and use the matching Action instance.
#. Meta-actions, which mutate the list of actions. This is the ``cancel``
   action, that cancels the last action and restores the previous game state.
#. Observers, which return information about the current game state.
#. Meta-observers, which return information about the modifications about the
   game state, this is the ``history`` observer, which returns the list of
   actions performed by the other players in the last round.

The observers are a really easy part, you just have to return some values from
the GameState and the rules::Player objects. For instance with my_player::

    int Api::my_player()
    {
        return player_->id;
    }

Implement all the other observers: ``get_column`` and ``get_cell``. In order to
call our gamestate-specific functions, you need to use the ``game_state_``
member.

The ``cancel`` function is already implemented in ``rules::Api``. Internally,
the Api class holds previous versions of the game state. The ``cancel`` method
restores the previous version as the current one, and removes the last action
from the action history.

The actions in the API are already implemented. Each action first calls the
appropriate ``check`` function, and if this returns OK, calls ``apply_on`` to
update our gamestate, and add the action to the actions list.


The rules object
----------------

Let's declare the functions that will be called by the player as void*()'s in
our rules.hh::

    using f_champion_init_game = void (*)();
    using f_champion_play_turn = void (*)();
    using f_champion_end_game = void (*)();


Then add these attributes to the Rules class::

    protected:
        f_champion_init_game champion_init_game;
        f_champion_play_turn champion_play_turn;
        f_champion_end_game champion_end_game;


In the ``Rules`` constructor, we have to retrieve the champion library:

.. code-block:: cpp
  :emphasize-lines: 8-13

  Rules::Rules(const rules::Options opt)
      : TurnBasedRules(opt), sandbox_(opt.time)
  {
      if (!opt.champion_lib.empty())
      {
          champion_dll_ = std::make_unique<utils::DLL>(opt.champion_lib);
  
        champion_init_game_ =
            champion_dll_->get<f_champion_init_game>("init_game");
        champion_play_turn_ =
            champion_dll_->get<f_champion_play_turn>("play_turn");
        champion_end_game_ =
            champion_dll_->get<f_champion_end_game>("end_game");
      }
  
      api_ = std::make_unique<Api>(
          std::make_unique<GameState>(opt.players), opt.player);
      register_actions();
  }


Then we can overload the functions defined in ``<rules/rules.hh>`` to satisfy
our needs. For instance, we want to overload ``at_player_start``,
``player_turn`` and ``at_player_end`` to execute the ``init_game``,
``play_turn`` and ``end_game`` client functions. To do so, we'll use the
sandbox object::

    void Rules::at_player_start(rules::ClientMessenger_sptr)
    {
        try
        {
            sandbox_.execute(champion_init_game_);
        }
        catch (utils::SandboxTimeout)
        {
            FATAL("player_start: timeout");
        }
    }

    void Rules::player_turn()
    {
        try
        {
            sandbox_.execute(champion_play_turn_);
        }
        catch (utils::SandboxTimeout)
        {
            FATAL("player_turn: timeout");
        }
    }

    void Rules::at_player_end(rules::ClientMessenger_sptr)
    {
        try
        {
            sandbox_.execute(champion_end_game_);
        }
        catch (utils::SandboxTimeout)
        {
            FATAL("player_end: timeout");
        }
    }


We also need to implement functions such as ``start_of_player_turn``,
``end_of_player_turn``, and ``is_finished`` that will call our gamestates
functions::

    void Rules::start_of_player_turn(unsigned int /* player_id */)
    {
        api_->game_state().increment_turn();
    }

    void Rules::end_of_player_turn(unsigned int /* player_id */)
    {
        // Clear the previous game states at the end of each turn (half-round)
        // We need the previous game states only for undo and history, therefore
        // old states are not needed anymore after the turn ends.
        api_->clear_old_game_states();
    }

    bool Rules::is_finished()
    {
        return api_->game_state().winner() != -1;
    }

In stechec2, there is a difference between turns and round. A **round** is made
up of 2 **turns**, one for each player. You can therefore overload the same
functions but for round specific needs, such as ``start_of_round``,
``end_of_round``, etc.

And that's it!

Debugging
=========

Debugging or testing the rules requires starting a server and multiple clients.
This process is simplified by the ``stechec2-run`` utility, but it still
requires you to have the champions compiled locally. This setup is not
straightforward and may not even reproduce a specific bug if the champions
generate random actions.

To create a standalone copy of a match, you can create a match replay file with
the ``--replay`` command line argument of ``stechec2-server``::

   stechec2-server --replay match.replay ...

The replay file can be read by the ``stechec2-replay`` utility, which only
requires the rules shared library to be present to replay a match::

   stechec2-replay --replay match.replay --rules rules.so

The replay file contains the map, if the game uses one, the list of actions
sent by the clients (champions and spectators) and the final score.  At the end
of the replayed match, ``stechec2-replay`` checks if the obtained score matches
the score saved in the reply file.

You can use this tool to replay a match that triggers a specific bug, or use
the replay file as a unit test.
